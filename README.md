hi, don't mind the repo name, it is just a placeholder.

if you've somehow managed to find this repository, that's cool i guess.
i haven't decided what kind of web app i want to make yet, so feel free to make some suggestions about what you think i should try to make.
don't spam if i haven't gotten back to you yet, or i won't consider your ideas.
if i like your suggestion, i will start on it and also give you access to the code too, so that you would be able to contribute to the project if you wanted to.
once the app is complete, i will have it up and running on github. (directly in the website, of course.)

put your suggestions in the discussions section please.
